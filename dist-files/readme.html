		<h1>b1gMail Readme</h1>

		<div id="content">
			<p>
				Thank you very much for purchasing b1gMail! In this package, you can find all files you need
				to install b1gMail onto your webspace.<br />
				This file contains summarized instructions how to set up b1gMail and how to update b1gMail
				from further versions to the current version. More detailed instructions are contained in
				the b1gMail manual - this readme file serves as a quick start introduction only.
			</p>

			<p>
				<h2>New / first installation</h2>

				If you are planning a new / first installation of b1gMail, please follow the following
				instructions.

				<ol>
					<li>Set up a new POP3 account an configure your CatchAll feature to redirect all incoming
						mails for the domains you would like to use with b1gMail to this POP3 account.
						(This step is not required in case you plan to install and use b1gMailServer for email
						receiving.)</li>
					<li>Upload all files and folders contained in the folder &quot;upload&quot; of this package
						to your webspace (e.g. using a FTP client).</li>
					<li>Provide the following files and folders at your webspace with writing permissions
						(normally <code>chmod 666</code> for files and <code>chmod 777</code> for folders):
						<ul>
							<li>serverlib/config.inc.php</li>
							<li>serverlib/version.inc.php</li>
							<li>admin/templates/cache/</li>
							<li>languages/</li>
							<li>logs/</li>
							<li>plugins/</li>
							<li>plugins/templates/</li>
							<li>plugins/templates/images/</li>
							<li>temp/</li>
							<li>temp/session/</li>
							<li>temp/cache/</li>
							<li>templates/modern/cache/</li>
							<li>data/</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>Open the set up wizard of b1gMail by visiting the folder <code>/setup/</code> in your browser
						(e.g. <code>http://www.your-domain.xy/b1gmail/setup/</code>) and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
					<li>After installing b1gMail successfully, <em>necessarily</em> delete the folder &quot;setup&quot; from
						your webspace.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				<h2>Update from a previous b1gMail7 version</h2>

				If you are using a previous version of b1gMail7, please use the appropriate <b>update package</b> instead
				of the complete package and follow the following instructions.<br />
				<font color="red">Always create a full back-up (database and files) before updating!</font>

				<ol>
					<li>In case you update from a b1gMail version older than 7.4.0-Beta1, log in to the administrator control
						pabel, go to &quot;Preferences&quot; &raquo; &quot;Email&quot; and ensure mails are storen in the file
						system (rather then in the database). Afterwards, even if this has already been the case, go to
						&quot;Tools&quot; &raquo; &quot;Optimize&quot; &raquo; &quot;File system&quot; and run the feature
						to move mails from database to file system. This is required to ensure that there are not more emails
						left in the database. <font color="red">In case this step is not done as described, the updater might
						deny the update later!</font>
					<li>Enable the maintenance mode (using the administrator control panel at &quot;Preferences&quot; &raquo;
						&quot;Common&quot;).</li>
					<li>Upload all files and folders contained in the folder &quot;upload&quot; of the update package
						to your webspace (e.g. using a FTP client). Overwrite existing files.</li>
					<li>Provide the following files and folders at your webspace with writing permissions
						(normally <code>chmod 666</code> for files and <code>chmod 777</code> for folders):
						<ul>
							<li>serverlib/config.inc.php</li>
							<li>serverlib/version.inc.php</li>
							<li>admin/templates/cache/</li>
							<li>languages/</li>
							<li>logs/</li>
							<li>plugins/</li>
							<li>plugins/css/</li>
							<li>plugins/js/</li>
							<li>plugins/templates/</li>
							<li>plugins/templates/images/</li>
							<li>temp/</li>
							<li>temp/session/</li>
							<li>temp/cache/</li>
							<li>templates/modern/cache/</li>
							<li>data/</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>Open the update wizard of b1gMail by visiting the file <code>/setup/update.php</code> in your browser
						(e.g. <code>http://www.your-domain.xy/b1gmail/setup/update.php</code>) and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
					<li>Optional: If you do not use b1gMail in UTF-8 mode but want to switch to UTF-8 mode,
						visit the file <code>/setup/utf8convert.php</code> in your web browser
						and follow the instructions of the conversion wizard.</li>
					<li>After updating b1gMail successfully, <em>necessarily</em> delete the folder &quot;setup&quot; from
						your webspace.</li>
					<li>If you are using b1gMailServer, please restart the bms-queue service.</li>
				</ol>
